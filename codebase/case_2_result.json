Nausea can be associated with migraine and neurological conditions. **Medication Appropriateness for Identified Condition:** Sumatriptan is a triptan medication used to treat acute migraine attacks. Propranolol is a beta-blocker commonly used for migraine prophylaxis. Naproxen is an NSAID used for pain relief, including headache. Ondansetron is an antiemetic used to treat nausea.
